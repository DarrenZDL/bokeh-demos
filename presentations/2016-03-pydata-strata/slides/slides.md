## Overview

- 11:30 - 12:30 Intro to Bokeh ecosystem (code-along)
- 12:30 - 13:30 LUNCH
- 13:30 - 14:30 Hands-on examples (tutorials or bring your own data)

---

## Getting set-up

- In order of simplicity:
 - Anaconda https://www.continuum.io/downloads
 - **Miniconda http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html (my personal preference)**
   
    `conda install bokeh`

 - Pip (can take a long time due to dependencies)

      `pip install bokeh`

***You don't need to do this now, we will be available to help duing lunch, so you're ready for the tutorials***

## Bokeh

<img class="slide_image" src="images/gallery-screenshot.png" style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;">

- data visualization
- web-based & interactive
- no javascript required
- large data
- streaming data


---

## Core concepts for today

- Overview of Bokeh's functionality
- Navigating Bokeh's interfaces 
 - charts, plotting, and probably not models!
- Bokeh server 
 - what it is, what it isn't, do I need it
- Sharing your work 
 - notebook, standalone files, server 
- Awareness of the Bokeh ecosystem

---

## Bokeh - Core

- Python-based - http://bokeh.pydata.org
- Charts (Bar chart, Histogram...)
- Custom plots
- User interactions & styling
- Server interactions

---

## Bokeh - Ecosystem

- Other language bindings: rbokeh (actively maintained), scala (activeley maintained), julia (not maintained), typescript (coming soon)
- Datashader - interact with BIG<sup>**</sup> data
- Write your own custom models

---

## Interfaces

There are a number of ways to use Bokeh - pick the one that's right for you:

* Charts (high speed)
* Plotting (sensible defaults)
* Models (high customization)

We'll come back to this multiple times today.

<h5 style="padding-top: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.2em"> `bokeh.charts` (high speed)</h5>

- One-line charts
- Processes your data & spits out a chart


<h5 style="padding-top: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.2em"> `bokeh.plotting` (sensible defaults)</h5>

- Tries to pick sensible defaults
- You organize your data, it organizes your plot

<h5 style="padding-top: 1em; margin-bottom: -0.2em"> `bokeh.models` (high customization)</h5>

- The lowest level
- Offers you the most control
- Do all the work yourself

## Interfaces

* Charts (high speed)
* Plotting (sensible defaults)
* Models (high customization)

## Bokeh Server

- deep interactivity
- streaming data

## Hacker-slides how-to

- Separate slides using '`---`' on a blank line
- Write github flavored markdown
- Click 'Present' (top right) when you're ready to talk
- There is also a speaker view, with notes - press '`s`'
- Press '`?`' with focus on the presentation for shortcuts
- <em>You can use html when necessary</em>
- Share the 'Present' URL with anyone you like!
